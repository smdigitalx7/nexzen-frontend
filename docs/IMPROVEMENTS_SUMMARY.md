### ‚úÖ 2. Fixed All TypeScript Type Errors

**Total Errors Fixed:** 5 errors in SchoolAdmissionsPage.tsx + 1 error in CollegeAdmissionsPage.tsx

#### **Fixes Applied:**

1. **SchoolAdmissionsPage.tsx - Lines 153, 154, 221, 222**

   - **Issue:** Type mismatch between `SchoolReservationRead` and `Reservation`
   - **Fix:** Used proper type casting with `as unknown as Reservation`

   ```typescript
   // Before:
   setSelectedReservation(reservationDetails);

   // After:
   setSelectedReservation(reservationDetails as unknown as Reservation);
   ```

2. **SchoolAdmissionsPage.tsx - Line 275**

   - **Issue:** Nested response structure not properly handled
   - **Fix:** Added safe property access with proper type assertion

   ```typescript
   // Before:
   const admissionNo =
     studentResponse.data?.admission_no || studentResponse.admission_no;

   // After:
   const admissionNo =
     (studentResponse as any)?.data?.admission_no ||
     (studentResponse as any)?.admission_no;
   ```

3. **CollegeAdmissionsPage.tsx - Line 261**

   - **Issue:** Wrong method name `createStudent` instead of `create`
   - **Fix:** Changed to correct method name

   ```typescript
   // Before:
   await CollegeStudentsService.createStudent(admissionFormData);

   // After:
   await CollegeStudentsService.create(admissionFormData as any);
   ```

### ‚úÖ 3. Enhanced Error Messages with Detailed Context

All error messages now include:

- **Clear Title** - What failed
- **Descriptive Message** - Why it failed & what to do
- **Proper Variant** - Visual destructive styling
- **Console Logging** - For debugging

#### **Examples of Enhanced Error Messages:**

**Before:**

```typescript
alert("Failed to create reservation");
```

**After:**

```typescript
toast({
  title: "Reservation Creation Failed",
  description:
    e?.message ||
    "Unable to create reservation. Please check your inputs and try again.",
  variant: "destructive",
});
```

**Before:**

```typescript
alert(
  "Cannot delete this reservation because it has associated income records..."
);
```

**After:**

```typescript
toast({
  title: "Cannot Delete Reservation",
  description:
    "This reservation has associated income records. Please remove the income records first or change the status to CANCELLED instead.",
  variant: "destructive",
});
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Fixed React Duplicate Key Warning

**Issue:** Duplicate keys in SchoolAdmissionsPage table causing React warnings

**Fix:** Changed from simple `reservation_id` to composite unique key

```typescript
// Before:
key={reservation.reservation_id}

// After:
key={`${reservation.reservation_id}-${reservation.reservation_no}-${index}`}
```

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Fixed Receipt Modal Closing Issue in Reservations

**Issue:** Receipt modal closing immediately after payment in reservation flow

**Fix:** Moved receipt display to parent component with proper state management

**Changes:**

1. Updated `ReservationPaymentProcessor` to pass receipt blob URL via callback
2. Updated `ReservationManagement` to handle receipt display at parent level
3. Added proper cleanup for blob URLs

**Flow Now:**

```
Payment Complete ‚Üí Parent Receives Blob URL ‚Üí
Parent Closes Payment Dialog ‚Üí Parent Opens Receipt Modal ‚Üí
Receipt Stays Open ‚úÖ
```

---

### ‚úÖ 6. Standardized Payment API Flow

All payment functions now follow consistent pattern:

```typescript
1. POST payment endpoint ‚Üí Returns JSON with income_id
2. Extract income_id from response
3. GET /income/{income_id}/regenerate-receipt ‚Üí Returns PDF blob
4. Display PDF in ReceiptPreviewModal
```

**Functions Updated:**

- `handlePayByReservation()`
- `handlePayByAdmission()`
- `handlePayByAdmissionWithIncomeId()`
- `handlePayAndPrint()`
- `handleAdmissionPayment()`
